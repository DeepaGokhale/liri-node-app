# liri-node-app
Liri bot helps you with your search - for a movie, song or a concert in town

There are really three commands -
1. 'concert-this' 'artist name'
2. 'movie-this' 'movie name'
3. 'spotify-this-song' 'song name'

if you forgot to add the second command it will pick a default for that action

I have attached some videos and screenshots to explain how it works
